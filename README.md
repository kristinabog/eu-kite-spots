### Strategy
The goal of this website is so kitesurfers easily can find a website where they can find the latest popular kitesurf spots or share them.

### Scope
After looking around on the internet, you can find websites about kitesurfing in general and with popular spots around the world but nowhere
can you find a website where you can add your own. This is what this website will specialize in. This way also experienced kitesurfers can share their
less touristic known spots to other kitesurfers around the world.

### Structure
Visitors are welcomed with an image to amaze them and see a kitesurfer in action. This give them the immediate idea what the website is about.
As they scroll down they will see an actual description of what the website is about. 

### Surface

#### Colour Scheme
Shades of teal, dark blue shade #344c5c, and white are chosen for the color scheme as it goes along with all the pictures of the kitesurf spots.

#### Typography
Montserrat is used as the general font-size of the website for it's clean typography and suitability with the logo. 
Cormorant Garamond is used for the dramatic headers to give it a touch of indie.

#### Imagery
Every image used on the website is a clear visualisation of what kitesurfing is, always chosen for the amazing looking backgrounds.
The home page has a gif with someone kitesurfing, so visitors can see the sport in action as a first interaction with the website.
